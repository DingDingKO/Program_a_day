# A program which makes use of eval and exec to execute random pieces of code, one of which being sys.exit()
# This is possibly the stupidest piece of code I have ever written, but I didn't realise just how powerful
# eval and exec.

# I don't need to write anymore programs now if I can just get a computer to do it for me. Who need GitHub Copilot when
# you have this?
