* A Pok√©mon styled animal game where each animal has different attack/defend moves.
* It uses an abstract class for all the general methods/data fields, then each animal extends the animal class
* to implement its own attack and defend methods.

* I think I bit off more than I can chew with this one, so I'll split it into two for tomorrow.
